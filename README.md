## Peak Demand Status

### Why?

TEP (Tucson Electric Power) instituted a peak electricity program to allow people to save money on electricity. During off peak times, you can use energy as you normally do, at a cheaper rate. During on peak times, however, the energy you use is more expensive. 

This is a website that shows whether the time is On Peak or Off Peak.

### Off Peak Times
- Weekends
- Summer Weekdays from 7:00 PM to 3:00 PM
- Winter Weekdays from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM and 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM

### Process
1. Checks if the day is a weekday or not. If not weekday: Off Peak!
2. Checks whether it is the summer or the winter.
3. Checks the times for each season.
